## Implementation details

- [ ] Setup [Apollo Server] (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server) 
- [ ] Implement a basic schema for the requirements of this solution
- [ ] Implement basic resolving for querying as well as mutating data
- [ ] Implement simple solution for handling authentication
- [ ] **Optional** - Implement simple integrationtests for ensuring feature completeness
- [ ] **Optional** - Setup service in a hosted enviroment

## Technical decisions

As time might be sparse, I'm considering skipping permanent storage for this simple implementation.

Given more time, it might be beneficial to look into document storage or a graph database for this particular system.

## Running the solution
